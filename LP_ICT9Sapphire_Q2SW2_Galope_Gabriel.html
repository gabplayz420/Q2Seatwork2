			<td class="description">The Devon Rex is a breed of shorthaired cat known for its crinkly yet silky coat and heart-shaped face. The cat’s crimped, or wavy, coat has outer guard hairs and a strong undercoat and can be any color or pattern of colors. The ears are very large, may be tufted, and are set wide apart. The eyes are large, and the color harmonizes with the coat color. The tail is long and tapering and abundantly furred. The Devon Rex is outgoing and affectionate toward people. It appears to wag its tail when happy, and that characteristic, along with its curly coat, earned it the nickname poodle cat.</td>

It has a light-colored body with color points of chocolate, seal, lilac, or blue on the mask, ears, tail, legs, and sometimes feet (which may also be white).

			<td align="center"><h2 style="font-size: 60px;">Persian</h2></td>
			<td class="description">Persian, also called Longhair, breed of domestic cat noted for its long, soft, flowing coat. Long-haired cats were originally known as Persians or Angoras. These names were later discarded in favour of the name longhair, although the cats are still commonly called Persians in the United States. The longhair, a medium-sized or large cat with a cobby (stocky), short-legged body, has a broad, round head, a snub nose, and a short, heavily haired tail. The large, round eyes may be blue, orange, golden, green, or copper-coloured, depending on the colour of the cat. The soft, finely textured coat forms a heavy ruff about the neck.</td>
